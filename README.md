# Hands-on_ML
A repository about the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn &amp; Tensorflow*, including the notes, sample codes in the book (with my comments), and the solutions to the exercise.

## Notes

- [Chapter 1](https://github.com/HaelChan/Hands-on_ML/blob/master/Chapter%201/README.md)
- [Chapter 2](https://github.com/HaelChan/Hands-on_ML/blob/master/Chapter%202/Chapter%202.ipynb)
- [Chapter 3](https://github.com/HaelChan/Hands-on_ML/blob/master/Chapter%203/Chapter%203.ipynb)
- [Chapter 4](https://github.com/HaelChan/Hands-on_ML/blob/master/Chapter%204/Chapter%204.ipynb) (updating)

Some concepts might have been covered in this [post](http://haelchan.me/2017/11/01/machine-learning-note/), I may include them again in these new notes.
